    surface_brightness(projected_radius, temperature, density, z, limit, model, pixel_edge_angle)

Calculate the observed surface_brightness at some projected radius on the sky.

The temperature and density functions should take the distance from origin (cluster centre) and return the appropriate value, with units.

The model should take these functions as input and return a vector of volume emissivities, where the vector element correspond with
the energy bins used to generate the mode. It should include the effects of redshift on the bins and time dilation on the count rate.

The limit controls limits on LOS radius during integration. Theoretically it should be ¬±infinity, but we may approximate it as a finite value.

The pixel edge angle is the angular size of a single pixel.

The result returned is the expected count rate per unit observing area, as a vector corresponding to the energy bins as used in the model.

`shape` describes the size of the source number as a number of spatial bins in each dimension.
The pixel edge angle describes the angular size observed by a single pixel in units such as arcseconds.
This area is assumed to be square with the edge angle giving the side length.
The emission model should be a function compatible with the requirements of the `surface_brightness` function, which it will be passed to.
The response function includes both the RMF and ARF, as described in `apply_response_function`.
