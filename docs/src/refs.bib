  abstract = {Nested sampling is an iterative integration procedure that shrinks the prior volume towards higher likelihoods by removing a "live" point at a time. A replacement point is drawn uniformly from the prior above an ever-increasing likelihood threshold. Thus, the problem of drawing from a space above a certain likelihood value arises naturally in nested sampling, making algorithms that solve this problem a key ingredient to the nested sampling framework. If the drawn points are distributed uniformly, the removal of a point shrinks the volume in a well-understood way, and the integration of nested sampling is unbiased. In this work, I develop a statistical test to check whether this is the case. This "Shrinkage Test" is useful to verify nested sampling algorithms in a controlled environment. I apply the shrinkage test to a test-problem, and show that some existing algorithms fail to pass it due to over-optimisation. I then demonstrate that a simple algorithm can be constructed which is robust against this type of problem. This RADFRIENDS algorithm is, however, inefficient in comparison to MULTINEST.},

  abstract = {We use N-body simulations to investigate the structure of dark halos in the standard Cold Dark Matter cosmogony. Halos are excised from simulations of cosmologically representative regions and are resimulated individually at high resolution. We study objects with masses ranging from those of dwarf galaxy halos to those of rich galaxy clusters. The spherically averaged density profiles of all our halos can be fit over two decades in radius by scaling a simple ``universal'' profile. The characteristic overdensity of a halo, or equivalently its concentration, correlates strongly with halo mass in a way which reflects the mass dependence of the epoch of halo formation. Halo profiles are approximately isothermal over a large range in radii, but are significantly shallower than \$r\^\{-2\}\$ near the center and steeper than \$r\^\{-2\}\$ near the virial radius. Matching the observed rotation curves of disk galaxies requires disk mass-to-light ratios to increase systematically with luminosity. Further, it suggests that the halos of bright galaxies depend only weakly on galaxy luminosity and have circular velocities significantly lower than the disk rotation speed. This may explain why luminosity and dynamics are uncorrelated in observed samples of binary galaxies and of satellite/spiral systems. For galaxy clusters, our halo models are consistent both with the presence of giant arcs and with the observed structure of the intracluster medium, and they suggest a simple explanation for the disparate estimates of cluster core radii found by previous authors. Our results also highlight two shortcomings of the CDM model. CDM halos are too concentrated to be consistent with the halo parameters inferred for dwarf irregulars, and the predicted abundance of galaxy halos is larger than the observed abundance of galaxies.},

  abstract = {We use the Millennium Simulation (MS) to study the statistics of {$\Lambda$} cold dark matter ({$\Lambda$}CDM) halo concentrations at z = 0. Our results confirm that the average halo concentration declines monotonically with mass; the concentration-mass relation is well fitted by a power law over three decades in mass, up to the most massive objects that form in a {$\Lambda$}CDM universe (\textasciitilde{} 1015 h-1 M{$\odot$}). This is in clear disagreement with the predictions of the model proposed by Bullock et al. for these rare objects, and agrees better with the original predictions of Navarro, Frenk \& White. The large volume surveyed, together with the unprecedented numerical resolution of the MS, allows us to estimate with confidence the distribution of concentrations and, consequently, the abundance of systems with unusual properties. About one in a hundred cluster haloes (M200 {$\greaterequivlnt$} 3 x 1014 h-1 M{$\odot$}) have concentrations exceeding c200 = 7.5, a result that may be useful in interpreting the likelihood of unusually strong massive gravitational lenses, such as Abell 1689, in the {$\Lambda$}CDM cosmogony. A similar fraction of about 1 per cent of galaxy-sized haloes (M200 \textasciitilde{} 1012 h -1 M{$\odot$}) have c200 {$<$} 4.5 and this could be relevant to models that attempt to reconcile the {$\Lambda$}CDM cosmology with rotation curves of low surface brightness galaxies by appealing to haloes of unexpectedly low concentration. We find that halo concentrations are independent of spin once haloes manifestly out of equilibrium have been removed from the sample. Compared to their relaxed brethren, the concentrations of out-of-equilibrium haloes tend to be lower and have more scatter, while their spins tend to be higher. A number of previously noted trends within the halo population are induced primarily by these properties of unrelaxed systems. Finally, we compare the result of predicting halo concentrations using the mass assembly history of the main progenitor with predictions based on simple arguments regarding the assembly time of all progenitors. The latter are typically as good or better than the former, suggesting that halo concentration depends not only on the evolutionary path of a halo's main progenitor, but on how and when all of its constituents collapsed to form non-linear objects. \textcopyright{} 2007 The Authors.

  abstract = {We present the first public release of our Bayesian inference tool, BAYES-X, for the analysis of X-ray observations of galaxy clusters. We illustrate the use of BAYES-X by analysing a set of four simulated clusters at z = 0.2-0.9 as they would be observed by a Chandra-like X-ray observatory. In both the simulations and the analysis pipeline we assume that the dark matter density follows a spherically symmetric Navarro, Frenk and White (NFW) profile and that the gas pressure is described by a generalized NFW (GNFW) profile. We then perform four sets of analyses. These include prior-only analyses and analyses in which we adopt wide uniform prior probability distributions on fg(r200) and on the model parameters describing the shape and slopes of the GNFW pressure profile, namely (c500, a, b, c). By numerically exploring the joint probability distribution of the cluster parameters given simulated Chandra-like data, we show that themodel and analysis technique can robustly return the simulated cluster input quantities, constrain the cluster physical parameters and reveal the degeneracies among the model parameters and cluster physical parameters.We then use BAYES-X to analyse Chandra data on the nearby cluster, A262, and derive the cluster physical and thermodynamic profiles. The results are in good agreement with other results given in literature for the cluster. To illustrate the performance of the Bayesian model selection, we also carried out analyses assuming an Einasto profile for the matter density and calculated the Bayes factor. The results of the model selection analyses for the simulated data favour the NFW model as expected. However, we find that the Einasto profile is preferred in the analysis of A262. The BAYES-X software, which is implemented in Fortran 90, is available at http://www.mrao.cam.ac.uk/facilities/software/bayesx/.},

It is assumed that the dark matter density follows a Navarro-Frenk-White (NFW) profile and that the gas pressure is described by a generalized NFW profile. By further demanding hydrostatic equilibrium and that the local gas fraction is small throughout the cluster, one obtains unique functional forms, dependent on basic cluster parameters, for the radial profiles of all the properties of interest in the cluster. We show that these profiles are consistent with both numerical simulations and multiwavelength observations of clusters. We also use our model to analyse six simulated Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (SZ) clusters as well as A611 SZ data from the Arcminute Microkelvin Imager. In each case, we derive the radial profile of the enclosed total mass and the gas pressure and show that the results are in good agreement with our model prediction. \textcopyright{} 2012 The Authors Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society \textcopyright{} 2012 RAS.},

  abstract = {We present gas and total mass profiles for 13 low-redshift, relaxed clusters spanning a temperature range 0.7-9 keV, derived from all available Chandra data of sufficient quality. In all clusters, gas-temperature profiles are measured to large radii (Vikhlinin et al.) so that direct hydrostatic mass estimates are possible to nearly r500 or beyond. The gas density was accurately traced to larger radii; its profile is not described well by a beta model, showing continuous steepening with radius. The derived {$\rho$}tot profiles and their scaling with mass generally follow the Navarro-Frenk-White model with concentration expected for dark matter halos in {$\Lambda$}CDM cosmology. However, in three cool clusters, we detect a central mass component in excess of the Navarro-Frenk-White profile, apparently associated with their cD galaxies. In the inner region (r{$<$}0.1r500), the gas density and temperature profiles exhibit significant scatter and trends with mass, but they become nearly self-similar at larger radii. Correspondingly, we find that the slope of the mass-temperature relation for these relaxed clusters is in good agreement with the simple self-similar behavior, M500\textasciitilde T{$\alpha$}, where {$\alpha$}=(1.5-1.6)+/-0.1, if the gas temperatures are measured excluding the central cool cores. The normalization of this M-T relation is significantly, by \textasciitilde 30\%, higher than most previous X-ray determinations. We derive accurate gas mass fraction profiles, which show an increase with both radius and cluster mass. The enclosed fgas profiles within r2500\textasciitilde =0.4r500 have not yet reached any asymptotic value and are still far (by a factor of 1.5-2) from the universal baryon fraction according to the cosmic microwave background (CMB) observations. The fgas trends become weaker and its values closer to universal at larger radii, in particular, in spherical shells r2500500.},
