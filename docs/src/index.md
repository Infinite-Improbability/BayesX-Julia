# BayesJ.jl Documentation

Bayesian inference on galaxy clusters in X-ray.

BayesJ is an unregistered Julia package. Install it with
```julia
pkg> add https://github.com/Infinite-Improbability/BayesX-Julia
```
You will need the AstroRegistry from <https://github.com/astro-group-bristol/AstroRegistry>.

This Julia version is adapted from the Fortran implementation presented in [olamaieBAYESXBayesianInference2015](@cite).
